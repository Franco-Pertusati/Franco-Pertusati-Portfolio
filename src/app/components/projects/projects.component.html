      A link shortener that uses an API built with ExpressJS and hosted on Render. From my frontend, developed in
      Angular, I can send a URL to shorten it, store it in Firebase, and later request it to be redirected to the
      original page. Additionally, it features a user creation system to monitor link activity.

      One of my first projects, developed with the knowledge I had at the time of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because I
      truly needed it for my job as a waiter and cashier in a bar. With this software, I can manage table orders, their
      bills, print tickets and order slips, as well as keep track of the cash register and some statistics.
